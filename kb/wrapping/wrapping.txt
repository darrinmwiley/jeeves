TAGS: convex hull, shoelace theorem, trigonometry
EXPLANATION:
1/ Evaluate the coordinates of the rectangle after rotation by v degrees
2/ Use Graham Scan to build a convex hull from the coordinates
3/ Use Shoelace Theorem to find the area of the convex hull
4/ Evaluate the fraction between area of rectangle and area of convex hull
