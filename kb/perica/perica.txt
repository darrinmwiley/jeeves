TAGS: combinatorics
EXPLANATION:
If an element has m elements below it, there are (m choose K-1) possible combinations 
such that the element is the maximum in the combination. If we sort the list, we can 
iterate over every possible maximum element. We then multiply the number of combinations
by the value and add it to the answer.
