PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/diplomacy
TAGS: bfs, graph diameter
EXPLANATION:
The answer to this problem is equivalent to the diameter of the graph, where the cost of traversing an edge is 1 iff the edge has two different colored nodes.
You can calculate this in an inelegant way by BFS'ing out from every possible middle node, which runs in V^3 time worst case
