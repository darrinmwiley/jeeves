TAGS: sorting, range-query, segment trees
EXPLANATION:
* The number of swaps for a smaller number is the number of elements before
* it in the array, except for the ones that have been sorted already.
* The opposite is true for large numbers
* 
* Enter an array of 1s in a segment tree
* For each element in order (1, N, 2, N-2, ...), get the sum of the values
* from the index to its target side of the array to get the number of swaps.
* Afterwards, subtract 1 from that index, effectively removing it from the array.
* 
* Example
* 4 1 3 5 2 : 1 has 1 element before it, it needs 1 swap, remove it from array
* 4 3 5 2 : 5 has 1 element above it, it needs 1 swap, remove it from array
* 4 3 2 : 2 has 2 elements before it, it needs 2 swaps
* 4 3 : 4 needs 1 swap
*
