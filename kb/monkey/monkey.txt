EXPLANATION: If you wanted to carry all the smoothie to another location,
* 				this would take ceiling(W/C) trips. However, once the weight
* 				goes down, the number of trips reduces. 
* 				Let t = ceiling(W/C). The smoothie removed is t*distance, 
* 				so we can choose to move all the smoothie a certain distance, 
* 				such that when we are done moving it, the remaining smoothie 
* 				is the next multiple of C. 
* 				We can keep doing this until the distance is short enough 
* 				for us to just take as much smoothie as possible and move 
* 				it to the end.
* 
* 				For the purposes of implementation, I represented W as k*C + r
