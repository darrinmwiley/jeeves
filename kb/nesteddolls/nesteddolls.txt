PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/nesteddolls
TAGS: sorting, dp, LIS
EXPLANATION:
the answer is the largest set of dolls where none of them fit each other. 
You know this set will be pareto optimal, so the problem becomes finding the largest pareto optimal set.
to do so, sort by one dimension and then find the longest increasing subsequence (in nlogn) of the resulting sort.
