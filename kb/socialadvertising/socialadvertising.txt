PROBLEM URL: https://open.kattis.com/problems/socialadvertising
TAGS: bitmask, brute-force
EXPLANATION:
- Scan through all possible combinations of people using bitmasks
  + If a person is included in the mask, mark that person and their friends as seen the ad
  + The final result will be minimum number of people included in the mask for all masks in which everyone can see the ad
- Time complexity for the above solution will be O(t*n*(2^n)) (n is number of friends, and t is number of test cases)
=> Max number of operations will be 10*20*(2^20) = 209,715,200 operations (which is possible in 1 second)
