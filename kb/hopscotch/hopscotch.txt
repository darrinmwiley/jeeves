TAGS: math, ncr, combinatorics, modular inverse
EXPLANATION:
separate dimensions into x and y

answer is the sum from i = 1 to n of (x paths of length i)*(y paths of length n)

to count number of paths, use ncr

how many ways to select i numbers that are at least X and sum to N?
first, allocate all i numbers X to begin with, then do stars and bars to
allocate the amount left over.

nCr must use modular inverse since it can be a large N
