TAGS: mst, dsu
EXPLANATION:
- Observation #1: if the system is represented as a tree, then all insecure buildings has to be leaves of that tree
=> Approach: 
- Build MST from secure buildings
- For each insecure buildings, connect it with the closest secure building (if any)
- If all buildings are not connected in the end, then the result will be "impossible"
- Else, the result will be the total cost

* Some edge cases to consider: 
- n = 1 => distance is 0 regardless of secure status
- n = 2 => if there is a direct between the 2 nodes, it is possible to make such connections (regardless whether they are secure or not)
