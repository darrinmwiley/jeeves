TAGS: math
EXPLANATION: We take the sums of all 8 subsets of x, y, and z
* 				The opportunity cost is the maximum difference of one
* 				of these subsets to a corresponding subset of another phone
* 				For each possible subset, we keep track of the max value among
* 				all phones, so we can quickly get the opportunity cost
* 				for each phone
*
