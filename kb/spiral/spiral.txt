PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/spiral
TAGS: bfs, sieve, implementation
EXPLANATION:
to create the spiral, follow a pattern of right, up, left, down where you increase your step count by 1 every 2 directions
use a sieve to find out which numbers are prime, and then just implement bfs between numbers.
to be safe I generated far more grid than needed
