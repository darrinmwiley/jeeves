TAGS: segment tree (beats?)
EXPLANATION:
- This problem can be solved using a special kind of Segment Tree, in which each node will keep track of the 
following information:
    + fmax - largest value in the current range
    + smax - largest value that is strictly smaller than fmax (second_max)
    + cnt_fmax - number of occurrences of fmax in the current range
    + fmax_pos - index of occurrence of fmax in the current range

    + fmin - smallest value in the current range
    + smin - smallest value that is strictly larger than fmin (second_min)
    + cnt_fmin - number of occurrences of fmin in the current range
    + fmin_pos - index of occurrence of fmin in the current range
 
 - Create 2 of such segment trees, one for x coordinates, one for y coordinates
 - Build the 2 trees based on the coordinates of the houses

 - For each query:
    + It can be seen that all the houses included in the range will be within the 
    square with side of length max(x_tree.fmax - x_tree.fmin, y_tree.fmax - y_tree.fmin)
    + It can be seen if there is only 1 house with x_tree.fmax as x coordinate, then the square may be able
    to shrink to max(x_tree.smax - x_tree.fmin, y_tree.fmax - y_tree.fmin)
        + If the removed house happens to be the only house that has its y-coordinates as y_tree.fmax or y_tree.fmin
        then we can further shrink the square to either max(x_tree.smax - x_tree.fmin, y_tree.smax - y_tree.fmin) or 
        max(x_tree.smax - x_tree.fmin, y_tree.fmax - y_tree.smin) respectively
        + Otherwise, the square will be max(x_tree.smax - x_tree.fmin, y_tree.fmax - y_tree.fmin)
    + Same observation can be applied if there is only one 1 house with x_tree.fmin as x coordinates
    + Remember to check the case in which only the y bounds can be shrinked
