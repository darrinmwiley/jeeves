PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/inversefactorial
TAGS: number theory, approximation, binary search, factorial, logarithm, digits, string
EXPLANATION:
Binary search over the number of digits. For a given n, use the logarithm of Stirling's Approximation
to compute the number of digits in n!. Hardcode all values of n < 7, as the number of digits there will
be repeated.
