TAGS: bellman ford
EXPLANATION:
bellman ford with a few tricky edge cases

1) if one portal leaves you in a new portal space, you must take that immediately. This can be accomplished by not creating edges outgoing from any portal square
2) if you reach the exit, you exit immediately. This is accomplished by not creating edges coming out of the exit square
3) don't create edges going in or out of tombstone squares
4) do create edges between any two adjacent squares who don't satisfy any of the above conditions.
5) when doing bellman ford, make sure not to update a square if it's not reachable yet. This ensures that if an unreachable negative weight cycle exists you will still get the correct answer.
