TAGS: dynamic programming, dp
EXPLANATION:
Stores the minimum number of presses required to get to each time. Every time is unreachable
by default (except 0, which takes 0 presses). For each p, times reachable from those which
took p presses to reach, and which have not already been reached, are reachable in p+1 times.
This stops when no new times are reached in one iteration.
