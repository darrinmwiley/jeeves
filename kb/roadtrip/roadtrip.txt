TAGS: sorting, sweep
EXPLANATION:
each gas station has an interval of time where it will be 'active', meaning inside of this interval, you could be using gas that came from that station.
sort the endpoints of these intervals and sweep through them, maintaining a sorted list of available station to get gas from.
Always take gas from the cheapest active station.
