TAGS: BFS
EXPLANATION:
there are a certain number of interesting locations*times. All others we can disregard.

Interesting locations*time pairs are 

1) the beginning spot at time 0
2) all oil can spots at the time oil cans appear
3) all spaces adjacent to oil can spots at the time oil cans appear

each interesting location*time has a certain energy profit and a certain point profit.

your complete state is encompassed by (interesting location*time id, energy left, profit)

bfs over the entire state space, keeping track of the largest profit achieved for each (location*time, energy) tuple encountered.
use pruning to eliminate suboptimal states.

The answer is the maximum profit of all states.

There are at most 500 interesting location*times, and any energy over ~100 is wasted (there are only 100 timesteps),
 so we only consider energy values of up to 100.
 
hence state space is (500*100)
