TAGS: flow, matching
EXPLANATION:
We can view this problem as a bipartite graph where vertical lines are on one side, and horizontal lines on the other.

We will connect two nodes if one line can be played directly after another. 
This is the case if two lines are of opposite types and share a point

Drawing a line is equivalent to removing a node from the graph, and the first person to not be able to remove another node loses.

If there is a perfect matching between nodes, Slavko can always remove match(x) right after Mirko removes X, which would guarantee Slavko taking the last node.

Otherwise, Mirko can start from an unmatched node. 
The node Slavko removes after Mirko is guaranteed to have a match. If it didn't, the node Mirko removed would be able to match with it.
If Mirko starts from an unmatched node, he can then always remove the match of any node Slavko removes afterwards. 
Hence Mirko will always have a move left and Slavko must lose

This shows that an optimal strategy exists for Slavko when a perfect matching exists, and an optimal strategy exists for Mirko otherwise.

We can implement the matching algorithm with max flow, as the runtime is (V+E)F, where F is the total flow. 
Because there are at most 500 nodes on each side of the bipartite graph, the max flow is at most 500. 

Hence complexity =~ (10,000)(500) = 5,000,000 operations
