PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/promotions
TAGS: graph, directed acyclic graph, DAG, depth first search, DFS, recursion
EXPLANATION:
There are two (converse) dags involved: one mapping employees to those that are worse-performing (worse)
and one mapping employees to those that are better-performing (better). The number of employees reachable
from each employee x (including x themself) is computed. In the 1-indexed list of employees chosen to be
promoted, the minimum (best case) index of any employee x is just the number reachableon better; the maximum
(worst case) index of any employee x is just the total number of employees minus the number reachable on worse.
