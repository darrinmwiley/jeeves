TAGS: implementation
EXPLANATION:
- Since the robot has to move to the right to reach the first house => we can add an 'R' at the front of the string
- Create an array that will store the result
- Split the string into substrings starting with an R, followed by (x) amount of L (x >= 0)
- e.g: R (x = 0), RLL (x = 2), RLLLLLL (x = 6)
- Create a variable called curr => set it to 0
- For each substring resulted from previous step, let the current substring be s[i..j] (0-indexed, i = index in original string of first letter in substring):
  + result[i] = curr + j-1+1
  + curr = result[i] 
- For each value in result array, 
  + If result[i] is not initialized, result[i] = result[i-1] - 1
