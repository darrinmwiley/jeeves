PROBLEM URL: https://open.kattis.com/problems/genefolding
TAGS: math
EXPLANATION: We make a rolling hash of the string, and do the same in the reverse direction
* Observation 1: We can iterate from the left, folding the first chance we can
* 					We see this by noticing that if we can make a bigger fold,
* 					the same result will be achieved anyways by greedily doing
* 					smaller folds
* 
* We do this from both the left and the right side.
* 
* Note: One bug was that I forgot to restart at the beginning of the string
* whenever I folded it.
