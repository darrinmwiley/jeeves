PROBLEM URL: https://open.kattis.com/problems/getshorty
TAGS: graph theory, shortest path
EXPLANATION:
* This is a straight-forward implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm
* The graph will have the intersections as vertices and corridor as edges
* => The problem becomes finding the path with max weight (weight being calculated by taking product of all edge weights)
