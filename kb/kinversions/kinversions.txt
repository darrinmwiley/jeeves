TAGS: FFT
EXPLANATION: 
* You can represent the string as two polynomials for B and A
* If a character is B, let that be a term in B's polynomial, and vice versa
* Let the powers for the B polynomial increase from the left, and from the right for A
* Example - BABA ==> B_B_ ==> (x^3 + 0 + x + 0)
*                ==> _A_A ==> (0 + x + 0 + x^3)
* 
* We see that when we multiply the polynomials, terms the same distance apart
* in the string get added to the same term. More exactly x^(N-1+i) is the number
* of pairs distance i apart.
* 
* FFT is used to efficiently multiply polynomials
