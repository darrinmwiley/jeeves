TAGS: math, binary search
EXPLANATION: 
* To solve this I used the Farey sequence
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence
* 
* The Farey sequence of order n is the ordered list of all rational a/b such that b <= n
* One property of these is that if a/b, p/q, and c/d are consecutive in a sequence of any order,
* then p/q = (a+c)/(b+d). This allows us to do a sort of binary search over rational fractions.
* Everything else is math to compare rational numbers. I needed int128 and I don't know if
* there is a solution without it.
