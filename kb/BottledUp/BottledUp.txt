PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/bottledup
TAGS: implementation, math
EXPLANATION:
- Let x be the number of large bottles, y be the number of small bottles
=> We want to solve the following equation: 
    + v1(x) + v2(y) = s (x, y are integers and x+y is minimized)
- Approach: 
    + Iterate through all possible x and determine if there is a valid y such that the above equation holds
    + Among all valid solutions, return the one that has minimized x+y
