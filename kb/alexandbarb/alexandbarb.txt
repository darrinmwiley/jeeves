TAGS: math, observation, dp
EXPLANATION:
- Let dp[i] be True if Alex can win if there are i cards on the stack initially
- When using dp on small dataset, it is possible to see that dp[i] = dp[i+n+m] for all i 
=> It is possible to say that dp[k] = dp[k%(n+m)]
- For all i in the range of [0, n+m-1]: dp[i] is False only when i < m

=> Approach: If (k%(n+m) < m), then Barb will win, else Alex wins
