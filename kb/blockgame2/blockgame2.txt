EXPLANATION:

for the case (a, b) where W.L.O.G a <= b, you know at some point the state of the problem must pass through (b%a, a).

if (b%a, a) is a forced move (the case that b = a+b%a), then there is no choice and you must make that move

Otherwise, you can choose to either take that game state yourself, or give it to your opponent.

(a, b%a+a) = take state yourself, because the opponent is forced to give it to you
(b%a, a) = give state to your opponent

Under the same logic of Euclid's GCD algorithm, this will give a logarithmic number of subproblems to solve. I memoized to be safe.
