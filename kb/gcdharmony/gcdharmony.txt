PROBLEM URL: https://open.kattis.com/problems/gcdharmony
TAGS: graph, dp
EXPLANATION: Choose a root node with degree one and visit nodes of the tree from the bottom up. Using dp to store results,
find the cost of maintaining gcd harmony in a subtree and changing its root node to a value v for all v between [1,10000]
and composed of primes between [1,100] by adding the cost of its children and changing the chosen node's value. The costs
found for a subtree of for value v can be used in a minimum between other values that also contain a common prime factor of v
in calculating the parent's cost.
