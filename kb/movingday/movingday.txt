TAGS: volume, geometry, maximum, long
EXPLANATION:
Loops through each box, computing its volume and updating the maximum volume. At the end, prints the maximum
box volume minus V. Volumes are represented as long longs because they could be up to 2^32 (which would allow
the use of an unsigned int), but they are also signed (i.e. the result of the subtraction).
