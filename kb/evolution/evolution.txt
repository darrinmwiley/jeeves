TAGS: vectors, sorting
EXPLANATION:
Sort input by length and then alphabetical order and attempt to split all the strings into two distinct genetic chains.
 Processes strings starting from the longest and iterates down the list. Two lists are used for each chain in case
 two smaller strings may fit into a larger one e.g. {CCMM, ACCA, AA, CC} could produce ACCA->AA || ACCA->CC but CCMM can
 only produce CCMM -> CC. Index variables i, j, ii, and jj keep track of the number of strings in each vector A, B, C, D
 respectively. Vectors A and C hold first chain possibilities and vectors B and D hold second chain possibilities.
 Whichever two add up to n hold the correct chains.
