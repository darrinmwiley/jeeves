PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/wordequations
TAGS: dp, greedy, dfs, dag
EXPLANATION:
it will never hurt us to take each letter at the earliest possible time. we can be greedy in that regard.

let dp[i][j] = the max number of letters that word i can cover, starting from position j

if word i is a leaf, we can naively calculate this

if word i is not a leaf, we will use as many letters as possible from the left child and then as many as possible from the right child, referencing dp in both cases.

make sure to solve subproblems in topological order. It is easy to do this using DFS.
