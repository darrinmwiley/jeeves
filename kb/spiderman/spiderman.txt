TAGS: dp
EXPLANATION:
let dp[i][j] = the minimum height required to do exercises [0..i] and end at height j.
you can then fill out dp[i+1][j+e[i+1]] and dp[i+1][j-e[i+1]] accordingly.
you can keep an auxiliary array keeping track of the string representation of these choices, and the solution will lie at aux[i][0]
