TAGS:math, meet-in-middle
EXPLANATION: We split the mansions into two even sets. We are able to
* 				go over all 3^12 < 600000 possibilities for either giving
* 				Jack or Jill the mansion, or throwing it out. We keep track of
* 				Jack and Jills total, and we map the difference in the sums
* 				to the maximum corresponding total for Jack.
* 
* 				We then iterate over the second set, keeping track of the
* 				sums like last time. 
* 
* 				Using the difference map, we are able to find whether an 
* 				arrangement of the first set can come together with the second set
* 				to create an even sum
* 
* 				We keep the maximum possible sum, and take 2*max away from
* 				the sum of all mansions to find the value of the mansions
* 				thrown away.
