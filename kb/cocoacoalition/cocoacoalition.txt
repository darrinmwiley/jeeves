TAGS: casework, math
EXPLANATION:
1) you can do any amount in 3 moves
   
   assume that for a given case b > m. 
   If that is not the case, you can obviously make a horizontal and vertical cut to the bottom row and have a 2 cut solution. 
    
   with the first move, you can get within m squares of the goal.
   with the second move, you can slice the bottom m squares from the board
   with the third move, you can make a vertical cut to that slice to make up the difference
2) a 1 cut solution exists only if n or m divides a - obvious that some number of rows or columns would have to make the exact amount
3) a 2 cut solution exists if there is a cut that leaves a 1 cut solution
