TAGS: math, observation
EXPLANATION:
once you transfer as many apples past the first gate as possible, the induced subproblem is identical.

the problem becomes repeatedly transferring as many apples to location i+1 as possible until you have no apples left. 

After this, print location + 1 as this is the gate you would be stopped at.
