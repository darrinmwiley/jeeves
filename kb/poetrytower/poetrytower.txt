PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/poetrytower
TAGS: brute force, hashing, flow, matching
EXPLANATION:
there are at most 8! different poems to verify, this is around 40,000

however, two poems are equivalent in validity if they are the same words in different orders

The number of sets of words is much smaller, 2^8, we can verify each combination and use it to verify poems.

To verify each combination, we'll use a bipartite matching via max flow. Each block can match to every letter corresponding to a letter on the block.
A block can match with any letter if it contains a '*'

If every character of a candidate string can be matched to a block, the combination is valid.

Test all and count.
