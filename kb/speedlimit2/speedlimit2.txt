TAGS: Tree, DFS, DP
EXPLANATION:

The main goal for this problem is for all weights to each vertex be equal
if they do not have a speed limit sign.

DP Cases:
1. If we make all the weights equal we must check all children for the weights to be equal.
    - DP_w = SUM {DP_w...}
2. If we put in a sign, the edges don't have to be of equal weights.
    - c*deg_v + SUM{best...}
        where best is the minimum of all dp values of this vertex.
    For this case we also need to consider changing the weight of the outgoing edge, as
    it may be beneficial to the next vertex.
