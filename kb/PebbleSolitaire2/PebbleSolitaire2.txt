TAGS: memoization, dynamic programming
EXPLANATION:
Observation: 
- It can be seen that the board state can be represented as binary representation of an integer

Approach: 
- Let the current board state be represented by an integer currState
=> For every moves that can be made, computed the next state and recursively solve the next state
=> Recurrence relation: 
f(currState) = min(Integer.bitCount(currState), f(nextState)) for all nextState
