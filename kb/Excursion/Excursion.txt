PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/excursion
TAGS: implementation
EXPLANATION:
- If the string is treated as an array of numbers, we can see that 
the problem requires us to count number of inversions in the array, meaning the number of pairs (i, j) in which i < j and a[i] > a[j]
- Approach:
    + For each element in the array: 
        The number of inversion in respect to the current element is the number of elements that were encountered in previous iterations that are greater
    than the current element
- Caution: Use long or long long to prevent overflow
