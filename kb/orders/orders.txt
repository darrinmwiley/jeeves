PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/orders
TAGS: dp, knapsack
EXPLANATION:

run a modified knapsack where instead of storing cost, you store the number of ways to make that amount.

0 = zero ways
1 = one way
2 = more than one way (we only care if it is ambiguous or not)

dp[i][j] = min(2, dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-cost[i]])

After this, trace back through the dp matrix to reproduce the sequence if it is possible and unambiguous.
If dp[i][j] == dp[i-1][j], you know you did not use the previous item. Otherwise you know you did.
