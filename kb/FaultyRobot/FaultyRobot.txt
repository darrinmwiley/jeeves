TAGS: dfs
EXPLANATION:
- Do a dfs on the graph while keeping track of 2 states: the current position, and whether the bug occurred
- If the bug occurred
  + If there is a forced path, follow the forced path
  + Else mark the node as possible stop and return
- If the bug has not occurred yet
  + If there is a forced path, consider the case in which the bug occurs at the current position and does not occur at the current position
  + DFS to non-forced neighbor (consider the case in which the bug occurs at the current position)
