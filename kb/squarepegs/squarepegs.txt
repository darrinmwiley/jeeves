PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/squarepegs
TAGS: math, geometry, greedy
EXPLANATION:
first, we can convert this problem into only using circles.
A square will fit into a plot iff its circumscribed circle does as well.

After the problem is all circles, we can greedily fill each plot with the largest applicable house. 

This is provably correct via replacement argument.
