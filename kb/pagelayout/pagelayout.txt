TAGS: backtracking
EXPLANATION:
- Represent the problem as a graph in which a vertex represents a story and an edge between 2 vertices means that 2 stories 
will overlap if both are included in the paper. Each vertex will have a value that corresponds to the story's area

=> Such representation boils the problem down to the following: 
  Given a graph, find a way to color some vertices such that no 2 colored vertices share the same edge and 
that the sum of values associated with the colored vertices is maximized 

=> It can be seen that this is a variant of the Graph Coloring problem, thus can be solved using backtracking
