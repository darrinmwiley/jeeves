TAGS: mst
EXPLANATION:
There is never a reason to send the same data over a channel more than once.

Hence for some MST, the entire program will be transmitted once for each station
that doesn't already have it. This amounts to a constant L*(N-S). Aside from this,
the only cost is that of creating the MST by activating communication channels.

Channels that start with the program are all connected with cost 0. After that, finish
the MST and report cost + L*(S-N).
