TAGS: binary search
EXPLANATION:
- Binary search the answer
- Let x be the current prime that is considered
  + Split the array in a way such that every sub-segments are >= x
  + If there are k segments, then x is obviously a possible answer
  + If there are less than k segments, then since k <= n, there is a way to split some sub-segments such that there will be k subsegments
  without changing the validity of the answer
  => x is also a possible answer
  + If there are more than k segments, then x cannot be the answer
  + Adjust the search space accordingly based on whether x is the answer
