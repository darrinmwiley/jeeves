PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/marblestree
TAGS: dfs, tree
EXPLANATION:
the only reason a marble should traverse an edge is if there is an imbalance between the two sides of the tree.
Another way of saying this is subtree size != number of marbles on a subtree.
hence the answer will be sum(abs(subtree size - subtree marbles)) over all vertices
