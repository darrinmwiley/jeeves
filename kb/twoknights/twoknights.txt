PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/twoknights
TAGS: dfs, implementation
EXPLANATION:
you can encode your state to a tuple (r1, c1, r2, c2, index), representing the locations of the two knights and how much of the poem you have already typed.
state size is 10*10*4*4*100 = 160,000. This is feasible.
If you can code the transition function cleanly, the problem is just a DFS implementation.
