PROBLEM URL: open.kattis.com/problems/railway
TAGS: graph, bfs
EXPLANATION:
represent each (switch, letter, direction) as a vertex of a graph. 

This will result in 6*N vertices and 4*N + 2*M edges

After constructing the graph, find the shortest non-trivial path from 
(1,A,outbound) to (1,A,outbound), and trace back through the path to determine
each switch configuration.
