EXPLANATION:
An alternating-sign divisibility hack works iff b^m = -1 mod d

resource on divisibility hacks to understand this conclusion:

so the problem becomes: find an m such that b^m = -1 mod d

suppose such an m exists. If b^m = -1 mod d, then b^2m = (b^m)(b^m) = (-1)(-1) = 1 mod d

since d is prime, you can apply Fermat's little theorem to say b^m = b^(d-1) mod d

"As a consequence of Lagrange's theorem, ord_n(a) always divides Ï†(n)" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_order)

by Lagrange's theorem, we know that the mutiplicative order of b divides d-1. 

From this we know that 2m divides d-1, so m must also divide d-1.

From here we can prime factorize d-1 in n^.25 using Pollard's Rho algorithm, permute factors, and then check each one by hand using modular exponentiation.
